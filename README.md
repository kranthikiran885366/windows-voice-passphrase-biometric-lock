A production-grade, cinematic AI voice biometric authentication system with emergency developer fail-safe mechanism. Inspired by the Sivaji movie security interface, featuring military-grade speaker recognition with real-time liveness detection, Windows integration, and zero-knowledge voice storage.

## Overview

Sivaji is a complete computer security system that:
- Authenticates users using voice biometrics (98%+ accuracy)
- Detects spoofed/synthetic voices in real-time
- Stores encrypted biometric data (never plaintext)
- Provides emergency developer access for system failures
- Integrates with Windows 10/11 login
- Offers cinematic UI with Sivaji-movie aesthetic

## Features

✅ **Voice Biometric Authentication** - MFCC + CNN+LSTM Deep Learning speaker recognition  
✅ **Liveness Detection** - Real-time pitch, frequency, and temporal variance analysis  
✅ **Developer Fail-Safe** - Emergency access mechanism (multi-layer authentication)  
✅ **AES-256 Encryption** - All biometric data encrypted with Fernet key management  
✅ **Cinematic UI** - Full-screen PyQt5 lockscreen with animated waveforms  
✅ **Sivaji-Style Voice Bot** - Authoritative, offline TTS responses  
✅ **Windows Integration** - Pre-login lock screen on Windows 10/11  
✅ **Audit Logging** - Encrypted timestamped access logs  
✅ **Security Escalation** - Auto-lockout after 3 failed attempts  
✅ **Multi-Biometric** - Optional face and iris recognition

## Quick Start

### 1. Install
\`\`\`bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
\`\`\`

### 2. Setup Developer Fail-Safe (First Time Only)
\`\`\`bash
python main.py --mode setup-developer-secret
# Enter a secure 12+ character secret
\`\`\`

### 3. Enroll Your Voice
\`\`\`bash
python main.py --mode enroll --username "authorized_user"
# Speak 5 prompted sentences
\`\`\`

### 4. Authenticate
\`\`\`bash
python main.py
# Speak the random sentence
# Access granted in ~1.5 seconds
\`\`\`

## Developer Fail-Safe System

### What is it?

An emergency access mechanism that activates ONLY when:
- Microphone hardware fails
- AI model crashes
- Voice authentication system becomes unavailable
- Critical system errors occur

### How to Use (Developer Only)

#### Step 1: Request One-Time Key (OTK)
\`\`\`bash
python main.py --mode request-otk --failure-type MICROPHONE_FAILURE
# OTK: a3f2b8c9d1e4f6a2b5c8d1e4f6a2b5c8d1e4f...
# Valid for 15 minutes (single-use only)
\`\`\`

#### Step 2: Input Fail-Safe Credentials
When system failure occurs:
1. Enter developer secret (what you know)
2. Press Ctrl+Alt+F12+D (physical confirmation)
3. Enter the OTK (what you have)

#### Step 3: Access Granted
System announces: *"Developer override authenticated. Emergency access granted."*

### Security Properties

Multi-factor authentication required:
1. **Developer Secret** - PBKDF2-SHA256 hashed, 100,000 iterations
2. **One-Time Key** - 32-byte cryptographic random, 15-minute validity
3. **Physical Confirmation** - Ctrl+Alt+F12+D key sequence

Rate limits:
- Maximum 3 uses per session
- 30-minute maximum duration
- Failed attempts logged and encrypted
- Tamper detection enabled

## System Requirements

- **OS**: Windows 10/11 or Linux/macOS for development
- **Python**: 3.9+
- **RAM**: 4GB minimum (8GB recommended for model training)
- **Microphone**: Required for voice enrollment and authentication
- **GPU**: Optional (CUDA for TensorFlow if available)

## Troubleshooting

**"Microphone unavailable"**

- Use developer fail-safe to recover

**"Model failed to load"**
- Ensure TensorFlow is installed correctly
- Verify GPU drivers (if using CUDA)
- Use `python main.py --mode test` for diagnostics

**"Too many failed attempts"**
- System locked for 15 minutes
- Try again after lockout expires
- Check audit logs in `logs/` directory

**"Developer fail-safe issues"**
- Verify fail-safe secret is correct
- Check one-time key expiry (15 minutes)
- Ensure physical key sequence is correct (Ctrl+Alt+F12+D)
- Run `python main.py --mode check-failsafe-status`
